# Credit Union Membership Data

## About this dataset

Contains membership data scraped from the credit union websites, as well as our determination if the membership is open (i.e. anyone in the US can join) or limited (e.g., only people living in a certain county can join).

- Disclaimer: authors not affiliated with the credit unions.
