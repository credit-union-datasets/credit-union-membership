# Credit Union Membership Data

## About this dataset

Contains membership data scraped from the credit union websites, as well as our determination if the membership is open (i.e. anyone in the US can join) or limited (e.g., only people living in a certain county can join).

- Disclaimer: authors not affiliated with the credit unions.

## See also

- Dataset "credit-union-websites" [Credit Union Website Addresses](https://github.com/credit-union-datasets/credit-union-websites) which contains the charter numbers that are the unique primary keys for both datasets, as well as website URLs for the credit unions (which is where we get the membership data). It could be set the "credit-union-websites" dataset is a pre-requisite for this "credit-union-membership" dataset.
